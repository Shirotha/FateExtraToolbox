# Fate/Extra Toolbox

This is a utility for the game fate/extra.

Battles are played out by a rock-paper-scissers like system where enemies choose 6 actions (**A**ttack, **B**reak, or **G**uard) each turn from a list of patterns but only reveal some of those to the player.

This tool will predict enemy actions by using previously seen patterns.

## Usage

Navigate the menus with the arrow keys, use enter to confirm and escape to cancel.

First select or create a collection (e.g. one for each chapter) and then select or create an enemy.

For each turn first input the known actions (A, B, G, or other for unknown). The most probable enemy patterns will be shown. Now enter the player actions (A, B, G, or other for skills etc.) and then confirm the results of each action (+ for win, - for loss, # for draw, others for unknown/skills).
